As part of the project where I am creating a [[tabata app|FinisherTechTabataApp]] to perform [[HIIT]] exercises, I decided to do all 21 [[Xtreme Turbo|XtremeTurbo]] workouts in a single week (3 workouts per day) in order to measure the number of repetitions I can perform in each exercise and also to populate an initial data base for this app.

''TODO'': this data will be friendly linked here soon (when the first version of the [[finisher.tech's tabata|FinisherTechTabataApp]] will be released).

Xtreme Turbo workouts did in one week (number 22 in 2019):
