I started to practice [[Calisthenics|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calisthenics]] in October of 2018 motivated by some videos published by coach [[SÃ©rgio Bertoluci]].

I realize that Calisthenics could be an excellent complement to [[Triathlon]] to turn me more strength for this last.
Also, it's simple to start the exercises because I can do it on my home, or in public places containing only minimal and simple equipment such as parallel or horizontal bars.

As a starting point to my Calisthenics training, I decided to do some [[Xtreme 21]] exercises. Nowadays, beyond doing this program, I also do my routine of workouts.
