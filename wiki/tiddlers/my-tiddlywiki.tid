My [[TiddlyWiki]] <<myRepo wiki "source code">> is available on {{GitHub}} and uses a lot of {{JavaScript}} code.

The <<myGitHubRepoFile wiki README.adoc>> in this repo explains how do I build it locally using {{Node.js}} (or a {{Docker}} container).
After its publication to GitHub, {{TravisCI}} is responsible to build and publishes it on {{GitHubPages}}.

By default, this wiki is published in ''Read Only Mode''. But, you can use the [[ToogleAdmin|$:/tools/ToggleAdmin]] tiddler to click on button ''Admin Mode'' in a way you can edit it. If you edit any tiddler or create a new one, the button {{$:/core/ui/Buttons/save-wiki}} will be colored in {{red||red}}. This means that you can save this wiki in a new file on your device.
